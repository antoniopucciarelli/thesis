\subsection{Feasible Design Study}

\begin{frame}{Interpolated Domain Study}
    Once the database is interpolated and refitted, it is necessary to understand the portion of domain that satisfies the engineering constraints of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Load tracking feasibility
        \item Exit angle feasibility
        \item Manufacturing feasibility expressed with optimization boundaries
        \item Catching of spikes like behaviour and possible bumps on the blade/load
    \end{itemize}
    This will bring to a reduction of the domain of interest based on these factors and/or a new optimization of the blades in the case of an internal point in the domain.
