\subsection{Dimensionality}

% Due to the multidimensional characteristics of the problem, it is necessary to reduce the field of study at its minimum.
% The dimensionality reduction allows using less parameters for the problem description and also to control better important correlation between flow properties and geometry features in the dataset. 

Due to the multidimensional characteristics of the problem, it is necessary to reduce the field of study to its minimum extent~\cite{clark2019step}. Dimensionality reduction enables the use of fewer parameters for problem description and provides better control over important correlations between flow properties and geometric features in the dataset.

\subsubsection{Macroscopic Flow Properties}

% A way of describing the macroscopic working conditions of the flow is to define:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item $\alpha_1$ : inlet flow angle
%     \item $\alpha_2$ : outlet flow angle
%     \item $M_2$ : outlet Mach number
%     \item $Re$: Reynolds number of the flow
% \end{itemize}

% These four parameters, represented in Figure~\ref{fig:aeroDuty}, are the minimum requirements for the
% definition of a working condition or duty of the blade. As result, these parameters will
% be indentified as aerodynamic duty of the blade.

These four parameters, represented in Figure~\ref{fig:aeroDuty}, are the minimum requirements for the definition of a working condition or duty of the blade. As a result, these parameters will be identified as the aerodynamic duty of the blade.

\input{tikz/aerodynamicDuty}

\subsubsection{Local Flow Properties}

% The loading distribution is defined by the surface fraction, $\frac{S}{S_{TOT}}$ and the Mach fraction number, $\frac{M}{M_{TE}}$.
% The load distribution is made using the surface fraction, $\frac{S}{S_{TOT}}$, instead of the chord because it allows to define better the local loading distribution
% in the region of critical interest, such as the leading edge, and to have a much direct correlation to the boundary layer behavior because 
% its properties are defined by the path length travelled by the flow.

% The loading distribution is parametrized by:

% \begin{itemize} 
%     \item leading edge Mach fraction ($M_{LE}$) which defines the load at the leading edge on the suction side of the blade
%     \item peak Mach fraction ($M_{PEAK}$) which is the peak Mach fraction on the suction side, representing the highest Mach value over the blade
%     \item pressure Mach number ($M_{PRESS}$) which is a double descriptor of the leading edge load on the suction side and the Mach fraction before the Mach fraction raises to reach the trailing edge on the pressure side
%     \item surface fraction position ($S_{PEAK}$) which is the position where the peak Mach fraction is positioned over the load distribution.
% \end{itemize}

% These parameters are pivotal in defining the local load distribution along the blade. 
% The loading distribution is made using a set of Bezier splines which are controlled by the parameters above.

The loading distribution is defined by the surface fraction, $\frac{S}{S_{TOT}}$, and the Mach fraction number, $\frac{M}{M_{TE}}$.
The load distribution is determined using the surface fraction, $\frac{S}{S_{TOT}}$, instead of the chord because it provides a better definition of the local loading distribution in critical regions, such as the leading edge, and has a more direct correlation with boundary layer behavior since its properties are defined by the path length traveled by the flow.

The loading distribution is parametrized by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Leading edge Mach fraction ($M_{LE}$): Defines the load at the leading edge on the suction side of the blade.
    \item Peak Mach fraction ($M_{PEAK}$): Represents the highest Mach value over the blade, found on the suction side.
    \item Pressure Mach number ($M_{PRESS}$): Provides a dual descriptor, indicating the leading edge load on the suction side and the Mach fraction before it rises to reach the trailing edge on the pressure side.
    \item Surface fraction position ($S_{PEAK}$): Identifies the position where the peak Mach fraction is located along the load distribution.
\end{itemize}

These parameters are crucial in defining the local load distribution along the blade. The loading distribution is constructed using a set of Bezier splines controlled by the parameters mentioned above.

\paragraph{Trial \& Error}

% Because the many possible loading distributions. A large investigation was made on suitable loading patterns. These patters are the ones which guarantee a geometry which fullfils the macroscopic and local flow properties.
% The reason of this investigation relies on the fact that the database has to contain only information which are useful for the aim of the work. Studying a loading distribution which does not have any geometry associated to the target loading distribution, it is completely unnecessary. 
% Fine-tuning the blade's loading distribution is crucial to meeting both manufacturing requirements and aerodynamic style constraints. A trial-and-error approach, particularly at the leading edge, enhances blade convergence and exit flow angle prediction, optimizing results while considering manufacturing limitations.

% Figure~\ref{fig:MLE}, Figure~\ref{fig:MPRESS}, Figure~\ref{fig:MPEAK} and Figure~\ref{fig:SPEAK} represent all the possible loading variation.

\subsubsection{Blade Geometry}

The blade geometry - consisting of the camberline, suction side and pressure side - is defined through meticulous parametrization, following Kulfan's approach.

\end{figure}

% The camberline is parametrized by the stagger angle ($\gamma$), the metal inlet angle ($\chi_1$), and the metal outlet angle ($\chi_2$). 
% The suction side and the pressure side of the blade are defined using a set of $N$ parameters, $A_i$.
% A blade can be scaled using more parameters by simply solving a linear system of equations. 
% Kulfan's parametrization retains critical geometric properties, including leading edge radius ($R_{LE}$) and trailing edge angle ($\beta$), significantly influencing blade characteristics and flow properties.

The suction side and the pressure side of the blade are defined using a set of $N$ parameters, $A_i$. Scaling a blade can be accomplished using additional parameters by solving a linear system of equations.

Kulfan's parametrization~\cite{kulfan2008universal} preserves critical geometric properties, including the leading-edge radius ($R_{LE}$) and the trailing-edge angle ($\beta$), which have a significant impact on blade characteristics and flow properties.

\paragraph{Dimensionality Adaptation}

% Optimizing blades involves solving multidimensional optimization problems with complex solutions. \texttt{datablade} adopts an intelligent strategy that adjusts the problem's dimensionality. Initially, optimization begins with fewer parameters to flatten the design space. Upon achieving convergence, the degree of freedom is increased incrementally, leading to improved solutions. Empirical tests have validated this approach, showcasing its effectiveness in constructing the database.

Empirical tests have validated this approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing the database.

\paragraph{Cost Function}

% The heart of blade optimization lies in managing two primary errors: load distribution and flow exit angle. These errors are quantified using the root mean squared error ($RMSE$) and the flow exit angle error ($\Delta \alpha_2$). The cost function, a blend of these properties, establishes guidelines for optimization convergence and acceptance thresholds for optimized blades. The function balances the importance of angle error ($\Delta \alpha_2$) relative to $RMSE$ using scaling and threshold values.

These errors are quantified using the root mean squared error ($RMSE$) and the flow exit angle error ($\Delta \alpha_2$). The cost function, which combines these properties, sets criteria for optimization convergence and establishes acceptance thresholds for optimized blades. The function balances the significance of the angle error ($\Delta \alpha_2$) relative to $RMSE$ through the use of scaling and threshold values.

\begin{align}
    & RMSE             = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \cdot \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \Bigg( \frac{M_{real}}{M_{TE, real}} \Bigg|_{i} - \frac{M_{target}}{M_{TE, target}} \Bigg|_{i} \Bigg)^2}

    \label{eqn:costFunction}

A significant portion of the blades demonstrates a cost below $2.75\%$, indicating convergence towards the desired aerodynamic style. However, it is worth noting that over $25\%$ of the database exhibits an exit flow angle error, $\Delta \alpha_2$, exceeding $1^{\circ}$, underscoring the need for correction.

\subsubsection{Error Distribution}

% Certain blades within the database present significant errors in the loading distribution ($RMSE$). These unfeasible designs, marked by bad input data, cannot be rectified by machine learning algorithms. Consequently, unfeasible designs are omitted from the database to provide meaningful data for interpolation.

Certain blades within the database exhibit significant errors in the loading distribution ($RMSE$). These infeasible designs, characterized by erroneous input data, cannot be rectified by machine learning algorithms. As a result, infeasible designs are excluded from the database to ensure the availability of meaningful data for interpolation. A threshold of $2.75\%$ is used as filter for refining the database.

\subsubsection{Filtering}

% To refine the database for interpolation purposes, data filtering is employed. Blades with inadmissible errors in blade loading are excluded, reducing the dataset slightly. The unfeasible designs are primarily situated at the boundaries of the domain, warranting their exclusion. The filtering process is primarily based on the cost properties of the blade, as it predominantly reflects $RMSE$.
% Blades with low $RMSE$ but high $\Delta \alpha_2$ will then be filtered numerically by the machine learning algorithm with a correction of the blade design function, $\hat{\mathnormal{f}}$.
% Table~\ref{tab:filteredDatabase} shows the database properties after the filtering operation.

The $\boldsymbol{x}$ vector stores the aerodyanmic style and aerodynamic duty of the blade and it is the general element within $\mathcal{X}$.
%     \item $\mathcal{Y}$: this dataset stores the camberline and Kulfan parameters, essential for characterizing each blade. It is structured as $\mathcal{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^{2787 \times 42}$, denoting $2787$ blades and $42$ parameters, including Kulfan parameters and pitch. The $\boldsymbol{y}$ vector stores the blade geometry properties and it is the general element within $\mathcal{Y}$.
% \end{itemize}
% The machine learning algorithm is entrusted with the task of approximating a mapping function, $\mathnormal{f}$, which bridges the two domains, $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$, as illustrated in Equation~\ref{eqn:mapFuncML}.

\subsection{Radial Basis Function}

% To achieve the goals, the choice of a suitable regression algorithm is imperative. In this research, radial basis functions (RBFs) are selected as the kernel of the machine learning model. RBFs, renowned for their robustness, prove to be a powerful tool for data interpolation. They adeptly manage overfitting issues and facilitate perfect interpolation of training points $(\boldsymbol{x}^*, \boldsymbol{y}^*)$. The kernel relies on parameters like length scale and the Euclidean norm between domain points, which contribute to its effectiveness in minimizing the influence of distant data points.
% The application of Gaussian functions in approximating the domain is another significant aspect, ensuring the smooth transition of geometrical properties of the blade, including camberline and Kulfan parameters.

This system is characterized by a linear system of equations, representing linear combinations of radial basis functions. These equations are weighted by parameters referred to as weights, $\boldsymbol{w}$, which are integral to fitting the radial basis functions into the database.

% Once $\boldsymbol{w}$ is computed, the chapter delves into the evaluation of weight quality using the test set $(\mathcal{X}^{**}, \mathcal{Y}^{**})$.

% Figure~\ref{fig:bladeML1}, Figure~\ref{fig:bladeML3} and Figure~\ref{fig:bladeML4} showblades generated from $\hat{\mathnormal{f}}$. It can be seen that the error over the $RMSE$ stays always lower than $3 \cdot 10^{-2}$ and the $\Delta \alpha_2$ is always lower than $0.5^{\circ}$.
% These results are acceptable for the purpose of the design tool generated by this work.

The work introduces Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a robust technique for simplifying complex datasets~\cite{geron2022hands}. In this context, PCA operates solely on the $\mathcal{Y}$ dataset.

PCA commences with a comprehensive analysis of correlations among various blade parameters:

\begin{itemize}
